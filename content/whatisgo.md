## Summary

Go is an ancient abstract board game, similar in nature to Chess, that has been played for nearly 3,000 years. It is considered to be the oldet game that is still played today. Go is a game about surrounding territory on a board, to score more points than your opponent. Two players take turns placing stones on a board, that is divided into intersections on a grid. A player scores points by surrounding more intersections than their opponent. Most commonly, the board is 19 intersections by 19 intersections (19x19). However, beginners are often taught how to play on smaller boards, like 9x9, and even 13x13.

Go has very few rules, making it pretty simple to learn. However, the game has enormous complexity, taking a life-time to master! There is a tremendous amount of depth to the game. Go rewards patience, and forces you to compromise with the other player. Being good at Go is not about overwhelming your opponent, but playing solid, patient, and calmly. Territory in the game can shift quickly in the game from moment to moment, and requires a player to be flexible. Unlike in Chess, there is a robust handicap system, that allows for players with skill gaps to play a fair and even game.

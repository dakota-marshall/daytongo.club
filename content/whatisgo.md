## Summary

Go is an ancient abstract board game, similar in nature to Chess, that has been played for nearly 3,000 years. It is considered to be the olded game that is still played today. Go is a game about surrounding territory on a board, to score more points than your opponent. Two players take turns placing stones on a board, that is divided into intersections on a grid. Most commonly, the board is 19 intersections by 19 intersections (19x19). However, beginners are often taught how to play on smaller boards, like 9x9, and 13x13
